    "# Functional Programming in Python\n",

    "## Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Functional Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming (FP) has at least several of the following characteristics:\n",
    "* Functions are first class (objects). Everything you can do with \"data\" can be done with functions themselves (such as passing a function to another function).\n",
    "* Recursion is used as a primary control structure. In some languages, no other \"loop\" construct exists.\n",
    "* There is a focus on list processing. Lists are often used with recursion on sublists as a substitute for loops.\n",
    "* \"Pure\" functional languages eschew side effects such as state (assigning first one, then another value to the same variable to track the program state).\n",
    "* FP either discourages or outright disallows statements, and instead works with the evaluation of expressions (functions plus arguments). In the purest sense, one program is one expression (plus supporting definitions).\n",
    "* FP worries about *what* is to be computed rather than *how* it is to be computed.\n",
    "* Much functional programming utilizes \"higher order\" functions (in other words, functions that operate on functions that operate on functions).\n",
    "Python *is* a multiparadigm language that makes FP easy to do when desired, and easy to mix with other programming styles even though Python is **not** a *pure* FP language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (Avoiding) Flow Control\n",
    "Problems arise with those side effects that come with state variables and mutable data structures; they often model concepts of the physical world of containers fairly well but it is difficult to reason about state at a given point in a program.\n",
    "One solution is to focus on describing \"what\" the data collection consists of. One shoud think when first given new data, \"Here's some data, what do I need to do with it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "Refactor code to put the data construction in a more isolated place i.e. in a function or method."
