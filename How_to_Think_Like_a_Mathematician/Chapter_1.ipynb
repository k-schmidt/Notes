    "### Sets\n",
    "##### Definition 1.1\n",
    "*A **set** is a well-defined collection of objects. The objects in the set are called **elements** or **members** of the set.*\n",
    "If $x$ is a member of the set $X$, then we write $x  \\in  X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Examples 1.2\n",
    "* The set containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is written {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The number 3 is an element of the set, i.e. $3 \\in $ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, but $6 \\notin $ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Also, the order of a set does not matter.\n",
    "* The set {dog, cat, mouse} is a set with three elements: dog, cat, mouse.\n",
    "* The set {1, 5, 12, {dog, cat}, {5, 72}} is the set containing the numbers 1, 5, 12, and the sets {dog, cat} and {5, 72}. Sets can contain sets as members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that {5} and 5 are not the same. {5} is an element of a set while 5 *is* a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Examples 1.3\n",
    "* The set $X = $ {1, 2, dog, {3, 4}, mouse} has five elements. We can write $1 \\in X$, and {3, 4} $\\in X$ but note that $3 \\notin X$ and $4 \\notin X$. The numbers 3 and 4 are not members of the set $X$ by themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some interesting sets of numbers\n",
    "##### Natural Numbers\n",
    "The set of **natural numbers** is {1, 2, 3, 4,...} and is denoted by $ \\mathbb {N} $. Natural numbers are referred to as the counting numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Integers\n",
    "The set of **integers** is {..., -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...} and is denoted by $\\mathbb {Z} $. The $\\mathbb Z$ symbol comes from the German word Zahlen, which means numbers. **Non-negative integers**, are respectively defined and denoted as {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...} and $\\mathbb Z^+$.\n",
    "* All natural numbers are integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rational Numbers\n",
    "The set of **rational numbers** is denoted by $\\mathbb Q$ and consists of all fractional numbers, i.e. $x \\in \\mathbb Q$ if $x$ can be written in the form $p/q$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers with $q \\ne 0$. Note that the representation is not unique since 80/5 = 16/1.\n",
    "* All integers are also rational numbers since we can write $x \\in \\mathbb Z$ as $x/1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Real Numbers\n",
    "The **real numbers**, denoted by $\\mathbb R$, are hard to define rigorously. For now, real numbers are numbers that can be given a decimal representation (including infinitely long representations) or as being represented as a point on an infinitely long number line.\n",
    "* The real numbers include all rational numbers (hence integers, hence natural numbers). Also, $\\pi$ and $e$ are real numbers but not rational numbers.\n",
    "* The set of real numbers that are not rational are called **irrational numbers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Complex Numbers\n",
    "**Complex Numbers**, denoted $\\mathbb C$, are created by pretending that the square root of -1 exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More on sets\n",
    "##### The empty set\n",
    "The most fundamental set in mathematics is the set with no elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Definition 1.4\n",
    "*The set with no elements is called the **empty set** and is denoted $\\emptyset$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Examples 1.5\n",
    "The set {$\\emptyset$} is the set that contains the empty set. This set has one element. Note that we can write $\\emptyset \\in$ {$\\emptyset$}, but we *cannot* write $\\emptyset \\in \\emptyset$ as the empty set has, by no definition, no elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Definition 1.6\n",
    "*Two sets are **equal** if they have the same elements. If set $X$ equals set $Y$, then we write $X = Y$. If not we write $X \\ne Y$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Examples 1.7\n",
    "* The sets {5, 7, 15} and {7, 15, 5} are equal.\n",
    "* The sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3} are not equal.\n",
    "* The sets {2, 3} and {{2}, 3} are not equal.\n",
    "* The sets $\\mathbb R$ and $\\mathbb N$ are not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Definition 1.8\n",
    "*If the set $X$ has a finite number of elements, then we say that $X$ is a **finite set**. If $X$ is finite, then the number of elements is called the **cardinality** of $X$ and is denoted $|X|$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Examples 1.9\n",
    "* The set {$\\emptyset$, 3, 4, cat} has cardinality of 4.\n",
    "* The set {$\\emptyset$, 3, {4, cat}} has cardinality of 3."
