** What Matters Most To You?
+ Health
+ Family/Girlfriend
+ Programming
+ Community

+ Live a life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear.

Work with stubbornness.
Work with it as openly and trustingly and diligently as you can.
Work with all your heart, because - I promise - if you show up for your work day after day after day after day, you just might get lucky enough some random morning to burst right into bloom.


Speak to your darkest and most negative interior voices the way a hostage negotiator speaks to a violent psychopath: calmy, but firmly.
Most of all, never back down. You cannot afford to back down. The life you are negotiating to save, after all, is your own.
